# Udacity FEND - MyReads

This project is a app I built as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. The app is a virtual bookcase that uses React to store users' books and keep track of what they are reading.

## How To Run The App

1. Download/clone this repository
2. Install all project dependencies and start up a server to serve up the site files from your local computer.
    * In a terminal, install all project dependencies in with `npm install`
    * Then start the development server with `npm start`
    * If you don't have npm installed, navigate to npm's [website](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to download and install the software.

## Backend Server

This project utilizes a backend server. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
